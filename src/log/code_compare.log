**Revised Code:** 10/10
- It follows the PEP8 style guide.
- It uses a docstring to document the function.
- It checks for invalid input and raises a ValueError if necessary.
- It calculates the surface area correctly.

**Actual Code:** 8/10
- It does not follow the PEP8 style guide (e.g., missing spaces around operators).
- It does not use a docstring to document the function.
- It does not check for invalid input and may produce incorrect results for negative values of radius or height.
- It calculates the surface area correctly.

Revised Code: 10/10
Actual Code: 8/10

The revised code is better because:

- It includes type hints for the function parameters and return value.
- It includes a docstring that explains the purpose of the function, the parameters it takes, and the value it returns.
- It includes error checking to ensure that the radius and height are positive.
- It rounds the result to two decimal places.
